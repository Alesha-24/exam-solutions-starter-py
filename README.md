# Exam Review 2020

A workspace for solving selected Python coding questions related to processing basic data structures.

## Setup

First, [fork this starter repo](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/exam-solutions-starter-py) under your own control, then clone or download your repo onto your local computer. Make sure to navigate there from the desktop:

```sh
cd exam-solutions-starter-py/
```

It is not necessary to leverage modules or third-party packages, but it may be helpful to do so. If you don't use any packages, you can use the Anaconda "base" environment with Python 3.7, otherwise setup a new virtual environment and install any packages you may want to use:

```sh
conda create -n exam-env python=3.7
conda activate exam-env

pip install pandas # for example, only if you want to use the pandas package
```

## Instructions

In each file in the "solutions" directory, write Python code to process the provided data and answer the provided questions.

```sh
python solutions/kitchen.py

python solutions/library.py

python solutions/reporting.py

python solutions/rideshare.py

python solutions/social.py
```

After solving one or more questions, make a commit to save your work. And remember to push back up to GitHub at least once before you're done.
